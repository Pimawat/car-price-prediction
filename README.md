# car-price-prediction
The purpose of this competition is to guess the price of a car using its characteristics. Not all characteristics can be used when predicting the price. Make predictions using machine learning algorithms or deep learning networks.


The evaluation criterion for this competition is the Mean Absolute Error, which calculates the modulus of the difference between the predicted value and the actual value for all data and returns the mean of the sum.
MSE will be calculated between the submit prediction and the actual price. Submit prediction should have 2 columns:
